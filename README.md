Task 7. Learning Reflection
One topic that I find challenging in the first week of a computer systems and applications course is understanding the concept of computer architecture and how different hardware components interact with each other to perform tasks. However, I also found difficult in browsing the OpenWRT website. 
To overcome this difficulty, I have revisit the lecture notes and slides, watch related online videos, and seek assistance from the tutor or classmates during tutorials. I also try to visualize the flow of information and data between different components using diagrams or animations to help them understand the concept better. Additionally, I have practiced working with the PowerShell commands to view computer hardware information and get hands-on experience with virtual machines like OpenWRT to apply the theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.
